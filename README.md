<b>Introduction</b>

Welcome to the <b>README.md</b> of this repo! The purpose of creating this project is to sharpen my coding skills.
In this file I'm going to tell you about this animated, starting from the tools that I used.


<b>The Challenge</b>


 My challenge is to build out this tab-bar navigation animated and get it looking as close to the design as possible and as my portofolio in the front end developer
 Animation that I made in this repository:
          <ul>
            <li>
                Make a tab navigation bar according to the design I made in figma and uploaded it to dribble
            </li>
            <li>
                The tab bar is inspired by the Instagram application tab bar on mobile phones and is made with different tools
            </li>
            <li>
                when one of the tools is clicked, it will move the animation with the transition and slightly enlarge the tools to find out the tools
            </li>
         </ul>      
            </li>
        </ul>
